# EMI Sense AI

> **"Don't just calculate your loan. Optimize it."**

EMI Sense AI is a premium, AI-powered loan optimization dashboard designed to act like a personal financial advisor. Rather than just computing standard monthly payments and interest costs, it evaluates your complete financial profile, models dynamic prepayment/refinancing optimizations, computes a Loan Health Index score, and provides structured strategic recommendations using LLM engines.
